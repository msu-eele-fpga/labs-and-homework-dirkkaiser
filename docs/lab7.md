# Lab 7: Verifying Custom Component using System Console and Devmem
## Objective
The objective of this lab was to verify our custom component with the JTAG system console as well as using the linux devmem program.

### Addressing (to show I was thinking)
When using the system console the address of our component was our base address of 0x0 through 0x8. When using our devmem program on the HPS the address was 0xff200000 through 0xff200008

## Questions

#### What hex value did you write to base_period to have a 0.125 second base period?
0x2

#### What hex value did you write to base_period to have a 0.5625 second base period?
0x9
